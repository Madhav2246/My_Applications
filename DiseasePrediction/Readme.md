# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict diseases based on patient symptoms using **Machine Learning (ML)** models. By training classifiers on medical datasets, this system can help in **early diagnosis** and support healthcare professionals in making data-driven decisions.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and encoding symptom data
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding disease distribution
- **Machine Learning Models:** Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest
- **Model Evaluation:** Accuracy scores and confusion matrices
- **Prediction System:** Identifies possible diseases based on symptoms

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- `Training.csv`: Contains symptom-disease mappings for training the model
- `Testing.csv`: Used for evaluating model performance

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualization)

## 🔍 Implementation Steps
### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded dataset and removed missing values
- Applied **Label Encoding** for categorical disease names

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized disease frequency using **Seaborn & Matplotlib**

### 3️⃣ Model Training
Trained three ML models:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naïve Bayes Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation
- Predicted diseases on test data
- Measured **accuracy and confusion matrices**

### 5️⃣ Future Enhancements
- Improving accuracy with **Deep Learning (CNNs/LSTMs)**
- Deploying as a **Web Application**

## 📊 Results
| Model | Accuracy |
|--------|----------|
| SVM | *[1.00]* |
| Naïve Bayes | *[1.00]* |
| Random Forest | *[97.6]* |
